description: A sensor visualization of MIT's Media Lab complex rendered by the DoppelLab
  project in Prof. Paradiso's Responsive Environments group. DoppelLab uses the popular
  game engine Unity3D to transform architectural models into a browsing environment
  for real-time sensor data visualizations, as well as an open-ended platform for
  building visual applications atop those data. Image by Prof. Joseph Paradiso
